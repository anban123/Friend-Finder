# Friend-Finder

Link: https://git.heroku.com/afternoon-temple-79185.git

Overview: In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' survey, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing and have deployed it on Heroku as well as github.

NPM Packages: express & path
